# WARAddonClient
A Client to recieve Addon-Data for Warhammer Online and handle the installation, removal and updating of them

This is meant to be a replacement for the Curse-Client, that no longer supports Warhammer Online. The website-version is at http://tools.idrinth.de/addons/ .

If you want to use this, the only thing needed is the jar-file in the folder bin, copy that to your Warhammer Online directory and run it.

If you got ideas or requests, just open a ticket here :)
